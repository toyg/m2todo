M2Todo 1.0
==========

Usage
==========

M2Todo is a simple program that takes .MM files produced by FreeMind, and
converts them to a todo list. Once you mark tasks as completed, you can save 
the resulting data in a .M2T file. 

If you modify the original .MM and want to see the changes merged with a
previously-generated .M2T, do the following:

1. Open the new MM

2. Click on Merge (Tools -> Merge)

3. Select the M2T you previously worked on. The view will change to show the merged output. 

4. Save the result as a new M2T or, more often, overwriting the existing one.
